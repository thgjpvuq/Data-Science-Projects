## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# install.packages("lattice")
library(lattice)
library(rmarkdown)

# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("a", "b", "c"),
  Value = c(1, 2, 3))

# plot with defaults
dotplot(
  x = Value ~ Name,
  data = df)
```
```{r}
# plot with parameters
dotplot(
  x = Value ~ Name,
  data = df,
  main = "Hello World",
  xlab = "Name",
  ylab = "Value"
)
```
```{r}
# create a barchart
barchart(
  x = Value ~ Name,
  data = df,
  main = "Hello World",
  col = "skyblue",
  xlab = "Name",
  ylab = "Value"
)
```
```{r}
# view help files
?barchart
?formula
